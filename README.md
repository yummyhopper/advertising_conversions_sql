# Advertising Conversions In SQL 

The goal of this project was to analyze a kaggle dataset detailing a social media ad campaign to
generate marketing insights using SQL for data manipulation and querying. I wanted to know which
advertisement was most effective and cost efficient with which demographics, and from this information
try to predict what the product was being advertised. This project contains three files

1. ad_conversions.sql: The SQL code I wrote to do the analysis
2. ad_conversions_dashboard.xlsx: The Excel Dashboard I put together to create visualizations
3. ad_conversions_write_up.pdf: The project description and reccomendations I made
