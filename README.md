### Introduction

The goal of this project was to analyze a social media ad campaign to generate marketing insights using SQL for data manipulation and querying. I wanted to know which advertisement was most effective and cost efficient with which demographics. This project was assigned for a Database Analytics class in Wharton and displays the comprehensive SQL tool belt I developed through the duration of the class.
